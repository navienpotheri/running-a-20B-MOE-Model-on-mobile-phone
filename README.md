# Topological Hidden-State Memory Manifold

A speculative Python and PyTorch implementation of a continuous-time agent memory substrate, replacing discrete episodic text buffers with continuous trajectory tracking across a geometric manifold.

## 🎯 1. Concept Overview

Standard Large Language Models and autonomous agent frameworks track conversational history by appending tokens to a static, linear context window. This model scales poorly at $O(N)$ or $O(N^2)$ computational complexity, forcing episodic fragmentation and catastrophic identity drift when context limits are reached.

This project implements a speculative **Topological Memory Engine** that maps memory as a continuous trajectory of a compressed belief-state vector ($\vec{s}_t \in \mathbb{R}^{64}$) moving across a geometric manifold. When a prompt hits the architecture, its 768-dimensional token activation space forces a localized warp on the manifold. The agent retains context not by reading past text records, but by evaluating its absolute coordinate position on this topological landscape—scaling at a flat, constant **$O(1)$ computational complexity**.

## 📐 2. Execution & Mathematical Pipeline

1. **State Vector Initialization:** The agent starts with an active belief state initialized at the origin of a 64-dimensional geometric sphere.
2. **Contextual Vector Field Warp:** Incoming 768-dimensional transformer hidden layer telemetry ($\vec{x}_t$) is concatenated with the current memory state and passed through a Lie-algebra equivalent network to calculate a velocity matrix:
   $$\vec{v}_t = \text{Warp}(\vec{s}_{t-1} \parallel \vec{x}_t)$$
3. **Euler Integration Trajectory Update:** The velocity vector updates the spatial location head of the memory vector:
   $$\vec{s}_t^- = \vec{s}_{t-1} + \vec{v}_t$$
4. **Hypersphere Coordinate Normalization:** To guarantee absolute mathematical stability across radical distribution shifts or conversational shocks, coordinates are projected back down onto a unit hypersphere shell using an $L_2$ boundary constraint:
   $$\vec{s}_t = \frac{\vec{s}_t^-}{\|\vec{s}_t^-\|_2}$$

## 🛠️ 3. Running the Architecture

Run the continuous tracking loop natively via Git Bash:

```bash
python manifold_memory.py
Verified Terminal Analytics (as seen in Screenshot 2026-07-05 152708.png)
The engine smoothly handles sharp conversational shocks (e.g., Input Telemetry jumping from 2.78 to 40.04), warping coordinates across the manifold to absorb contextual shifts without experiencing value explosion:

1. Input Telemetry Norm (The Force of the Prompt)
This measures the magnitude or "energy" of the incoming LLM activation vector ( xt ).

Conversation Step [1] has a baseline norm of 2.7807.

Conversation Step [2] encounters a massive spike up to 40.0431. This represents a huge injection of unexpected data, a radical shift in context, or an intentional conversational shock.

Conversation Step [3] drops back down to a stabilized 5.5875, showing a return to normal conversational flow.

2. Manifold Displacement (The Memory Vector Warp)
This is the Euclidean distance (L2space) between where the agent's memory was before the prompt, and where it ended up after the prompt forced it to move.

Because Step [2] hit the system with an enormous token telemetry norm (40.0431), it generated a high velocity vector that warped your memory state coordinates by a distance of 1.1019.

In contrast, Step [3] was relatively stable, resulting in a displacement of only 0.6407.

Because your code implements an L2  normalization step (p=2), the coordinates are constrained to stay tightly bounded on a geometric hypersphere shell. This keeps your state space stable, preventing the vectors from infinitely exploding during conversational shocks.

3. Current Memory Coordinate Head (The State Coordinates)
These truncated float values represent the exact location head of your 64-dimensional belief state ( 
st ) on the manifold. Notice how the coordinates shift radically from Step [1] to Step [2] (e.g., the first coordinate flips from negative −0.1472 to positive 0.0845) to absorb the unexpected input, and then stabilizes in Step [3] (0.0086).

The Big Picture Conclusion
As noted in the terminal output, the trajectory continuum is secured. Because the engine compresses all incoming context directly into spatial shifts of these 64 numbers, your memory processing operates at a flat O(1) constant computational scale. No matter how long this conversation runs, the agent will never have to re-read past tokens to retain context—it simply keeps tracking its ongoing movement along this topological geometric landscape.
